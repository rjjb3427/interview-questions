# Stupid Interview Questions

This is a collection of solutions to stupid interview questions I've received. I really dislike CS puzzles. They are pointless and don't test your real world ability to create things.

There are my solutions. I tried to spell out in the comments what the problem was and my thought process. Maybe this is useful to someone.

Do whatever you want with these. MIT license. Plesase don't ask them to people.
