# The problem was to find the shortest sum going to the bottom of the tree. You can only move
# right or left when going down the tree.
#
# I chose to just collect all of the possible paths using recursion and then loop through
# until I got the answer. Not the most effective, but hey.
#
# I think this is O(2^n) since 2^n are the possible number of paths in the tree. Since the
# tree could contain negative numbers, the best you could do is O(n). My first thought for a
# performance improvement was to cache the sums of the tree in a half size sum tree, but that
# would still be the same number of recursions and iterations, just less summing.
#
# Overall, I think this problem is stupid. Doing tree traversal, is something I never do in
# practice. Ever. I'm sure watching me try to figure out the recursion (not something I do
# often either, although a practical skill to have) was pretty entertaining.
#
# I think I took about 20 minutes to solve it.
